	abstract = {Research Summary This article develops a theoretical framework to explicate how third parties, who are not transactionally involved in a given exchange relationship, can promote or impede the creation and capture of value by influencing market actor beliefs and behaviors. I investigate these issues empirically through an abductive mixed-method case study of the Michelin Guide's entry into New York City. An examination of two decades of the openings and closings of New York City's elite restaurants indicates that receiving a Michelin star corresponded to an increased likelihood of restaurant exit. Michelin stars appear to have fostered disruptions at recipients' upstream and downstream interfaces, which inhibited their ability to capture value. This ultimately underscores how value network reactivity to third-party evaluations may lead to unintended consequences for firms. Managerial Summary This article explains how third-party evaluators' reviews, ratings, and rankings can promote or impede the creation and capture of value. This occurs because third-party evaluations engender reactions by those being evaluated, as well as reactions by other market actors such as competitors and exchange partners. I study these issues within the context of the Michelin Guide's entry into New York City, and my findings indicate that restaurants that received a Michelin star were more likely to close in subsequent years. Evidence suggests that intensified bargaining problems with landlords, suppliers, and employees, along with heightened consumer expectations, created new challenges for these Michelin-starred restaurants, which ultimately made it more difficult for them to stay in business.},

	abstract = {We analyze whether consumers' quality perception and/or producer investment of New York City restaurants, measured by Zagat scores, responds to newly appearing expert opinion, measured by Michelin scores. Answering this question is of general economic interest as it applies to all markets with information asymmetries. Employing a difference-in-differences approach as well as a propensity score matching approach we find significant Michelin treatment effects on food and décor quality. Based on these changes, we find a Michelin-induced price increase of approximately 30\% per Michelin star. To examine whether the improved food and nonfood quality is based on restaurant investments or is merely imagined, we analyze nonfood investments by referring to Wine Spectator wine list awards. Our analysis suggests that Michelin-reviewed restaurants are significantly more likely to invest in their wine list than others. As a result, Michelin reviewed restaurants are more likely to improve food and nonfood (esp. décor) quality leading to significant price increases. However, while restaurants that increase prices only due to décor and service improvements are more likely to go out of business, food improvements appear to secure a restaurant's survival.

	abstract = {Receiving Michelin stars is considered an effective marketing tool and a prestigious certification in the restaurant industry. However, the direct effects of Michelin stars on restaurant performance remain unclear. To bridge this gap, this study aims to empirically validate the “Michelin effect” on the consumption values of restaurant patrons before and after receiving Michelin stars.,The data, collected from OpenTable, consist of over 160,000 reviews written for 218 restaurants, including 109 Michelin-starred (treatment group) and 109 nonstarred restaurants (control group). The authors measure perceived consumption value using the collected user-generated review data. The authors estimate fixed-effect difference-in-differences regressions to validate the Michelin effect.,Michelin stars enhance social, hedonic and service quality values, which are nonfunctional values. However, no significant effects on functional consumption values, such as economic, food quality and ambience quality values, are observed, even though Michelin stars are pure awards for kitchen performance.,Michelin stars can be an effective marketing tool for fine-dining restaurants because customers consider emotional and nonfunctional benefits such as hedonic and social values, which are more important than functional benefits such as food value. Furthermore, Michelin effects are heterogeneous depending on the number of stars awarded, price range and customers’ gastronomic involvement. These offer a strong rationale for monitoring social media, which may help managers better understand their customers and improve their performance.,This study extends the current literature on the Michelin effect by quantifying consumption values using user-generated review data. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study offers the first empirical evidence that directly validates the Michelin effect.},

	abstract = {This article contains a complete list of Michelin-starred restaurants in New York City and Westchester County. 
The Michelin Guides have been published by the French tire company Michelin since 1900. They were designed as a guide to tell drivers about eateries they recommended to visit and to subtly sponsor their tires, by encouraging drivers to use their cars more and therefore need to replace the tires as they wore out. Over time, the stars that were given out started to become more valuable.
Multiple anonymous Michelin inspectors visit the restaurants several times. They rate the restaurants on five criteria: "quality of products", "mastery of flavor and cooking techniques", "the personality of the chef represented in the dining experience", "value for money", and "consistency between inspectors' visits". Inspectors have at least ten years of expertise and create a list of popular restaurants supported by media reports, reviews, and diner popularity. If they reach a consensus, Michelin awards restaurants from one to three stars based on its evaluation methodology: One star means "high-quality cooking, worth a stop", two stars signify "excellent cooking, worth a detour", and three stars denote "exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey". The stars are not permanent and restaurants are constantly being re-evaluated. If the criteria are not met, the restaurant will lose its stars.
The 2006 edition was the first edition of the Michelin Guide to New York City to be published. It was the first time that Michelin published a Red Guide for a region outside Europe. In the 2020 edition, the Guide began to include restaurants outside the city's five boroughs, adding Westchester County restaurants to its listing.},
